# VOT2
My VOT project

It's a website with a login/login page and a page where you enter how many calories, fats and sugars you've eaten and it tells you how much you've eaten.

I use html, css, javascript to create the site

I use AWS Amplify to scale the static pages

I use API Gateway for sysdawane na REST API, which I use for communication between the site and Amazon Lambda

I use DynamoB for database and python Lambda functions
